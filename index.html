        <h2 class="h3"><em>Hi! We are an English language group. My name is Parvina, my friend Ulmas, and our wonderful teacher is Ibrogim. Ulmas and I want to learn how to speak English fluently. We are currently in high school. I'm 12, Ulmas is 14, and our teacher is 29. Sometimes we are too lazy to do our homework. And Ibrogim tells us: "Children, do not waste your time on all sorts of toys. Tell me what you are richer than me? In time, in time, you are richer than I am. Appreciate it! " Now we want to become programmers.We learn on the Geekbrains platform. We learn how to create different websites, 3d games, and so on. Our teacher helps us as much as he can. And our parents also helped us. We hope that you will like this site THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO HELPS US WITH THIS!</em></h2>
